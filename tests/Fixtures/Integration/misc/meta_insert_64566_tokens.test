--TEST--
Test of super huge file that would require 64566 tokens to be inserted! Basically, this tests Tokens::insertSlices, without which this test would take few hours to execute.

Test is disabled for MacOS because it regularly fails with timeout (see: https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/7141)
