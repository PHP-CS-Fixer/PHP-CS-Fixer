I tested this branch on a project and I can't wait for this to be merged.

What's left to do ? I might dedicate some time to get this in asap! Thanks

Maybe more review would be nice to be more confident this won't break things, any help is welcome :)

@keradus did you review this fully?

unfortunately not at all, was focusing on PHP8.1/Symfony6 reviews. maybe someone else can review this PR?

@kubawerlos already did. Given that several people reported the changes in this PR fixed the issue for them, I consider this can be merged.
