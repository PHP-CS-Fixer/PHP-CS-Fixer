@keradus The changed variable `VERSION_CB` is used in `wget -qO- "https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/devscripts/devscripts_${VERSION_CB}.tar.xz"`. For the old value, it returns 404, so it looks like the location from which the script is downloaded will be changed.

all PR's are currently failing SCA set, for example:
https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/runs/5232717511?check_suite_focus=true

this is because the location:

>https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/devscripts/devscripts_2.21.7.tar.xz

returns 404

the updated location

>https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/devscripts/devscripts_2.21.7~bpo11+1.tar.xz

works

However, since the install script of the SCA exits on the first error it hasn't run all the other tooling, like stan and psalm, either, which is what is the rest of the PR will be about.
