Any news on this? @keradus

Also why change the branch to 3.0?
From contributing "If you are fixing a bug or typo, improving tests or for any small tweak: the lowest branch where the changes can be applied. Once your Pull Request is accepted, the changes will get merged up to highest branches."
Would this fix, if merged, be merged to 2.x too?

Or should it be considered a bug?

Probably a bug since this wasn't the desired effect?
