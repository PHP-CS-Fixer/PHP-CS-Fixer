> RandomApiMigrationFixer - add option to migrate to "random_int"

it's *not* adding any option - one can already migrate to `random_int`. Even `PHP70MigrationRisky` set is doing that

I was wrong thinking adding support here indeed. It is because this is also supported currently:
```
            [
                '<?php foo();',
                '<?php rand();',
                ['replacements' => ['rand' => 'foo']],
            ],
```
making it a more generic function renaming rule than I expected. I was expecting known PHP random methods as input _and_ as output.
Anyway, besides the docs this PR also adds proper argument counts for using `random_int` as input FWIW
