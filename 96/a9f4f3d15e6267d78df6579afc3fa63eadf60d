Are there data providers and unnecessary skipping to clean up in the tests?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

potentially, there are.
yet, that cleanup is not providing the biggest value to justify prioritizing effort for it

when I checked initially there was somemething still blocking, but maybe it's no longer the case. I was also thinking about lower PHPUnit. Let's check after this one is merged
