>I don't see any tests covering echo. We should maybe make sure it doesn't

not sure I understand, what would that test look like?

note that is valid:
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$a = sprintf(...);

echo $a('foo %d', 23);
```

however this is not allowed:
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

$a = echo(...);

echo $a('foo');
```

would be great if language constructs like `echo`, `isset`, and `unset` , but they aren't
(maybe we could ping the PHP team)

Yeh, not sure. I guess I was just trying to make sure we didn't break code by mistake. It looks like we're all good.
