Hi and thanks for taking the time to propose this improvement!

Currently the documentation gets generated from the various source files. For this case, please also update this file:
>https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/v3.1.0/src/RuleSet/Sets/DoctrineAnnotationSet.php#L40

after that we'll run the tests/CI and if all green will merge it :+1:

Thank you for the hint :)

I have updated the URL in the DoctrineAnnotationSet source now, too.

thanks so much! :)
can I ask you one more thing, can you maybe rebase (on top of master) and squash the commits?

No problem at all. The branch is now rebased and the commits were sqashed.
