By the way this one is heavily inspired by `ArrayIndentationFixer`, which I think received some fixes/improvements. I have to check if they have to be applied to `StatementIndentationFixer` as well.

Maybe we can have a test for `enum` as well

Rebased:
* test cases with `enum` added;
* bug with `match` expression fixed;
* "current line indent" detection refactored;
