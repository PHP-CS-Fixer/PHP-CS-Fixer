===================================
Rule ``yield_from_array_to_yields``
===================================

Yield from array must be unpacked to series of yields.

Description
-----------

The conversion will make the array in ``yield from`` changed in arrays of 1 less
dimension.

Warning
-------

Using this rule is risky
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rule is risky in case of ``yield from`` being used multiple times within
single function scope, while using list-alike data sources (e.g. ``function
foo() { yield from ["a"]; yield from ["b"]; }``). It only matters when consuming
such iterator with key-value context, because set of yielded keys may be changed
after applying this rule.

Examples
--------
