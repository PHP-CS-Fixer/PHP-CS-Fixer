====================================
Rule ``escape_implicit_backslashes``
====================================

Escape implicit backslashes in strings and heredocs to ease the understanding of
which are special chars interpreted by PHP and which not.

Description
-----------

In PHP double-quoted strings and heredocs some chars like ``n``, ``$`` or ``u``
have special meanings if preceded by a backslash (and some are special only if
followed by other special chars), while a backslash preceding other chars are
interpreted like a plain backslash. The precise list of those special chars is
hard to remember and to identify quickly: this fixer escapes backslashes that do
not start a special interpretation with the char after them.
It is possible to fix also single-quoted strings: in this case there is no
special chars apart from single-quote and backslash itself, so the fixer simply
ensure that all backslashes are escaped. Both single and double backslashes are
allowed in single-quoted strings, so the purpose in this context is mainly to
have a uniformed way to have them written all over the codebase.

Rule sets
---------

The rule is part of the following rule set:

@PhpCsFixer
  Using the `@PhpCsFixer <./../../ruleSets/PhpCsFixer.rst>`_ rule set will enable the ``escape_implicit_backslashes`` rule with the default config.
