Do we have an idea how many users are "stuck" on SF4 that (still) use the tool as a direct (dev) dependency in their composer.json?

very good question, @SpacePossum .
I already run "experimental" releases (published together) to collect the numbers
```
3.3.0 - regular release
3.3.1 - PHP 7.2 required
3.3.2 - PHP 7.2 required + Symfony 5 required
```

[so far...](https://packagist.org/packages/friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer/stats#v3.3.0)
```
3.3.0 -   65 installations
3.3.1 -  140 installations
3.3.2 - 2300 installations
```

I'm not sure dropping this adds much value. We don't have any 4.x specific work arounds in the codebase?

during the last call, we decided to not include it in newest release that is adding support for PHP 8.1.
I would like to include it in next release.

Hi, Symfony v4.4 is an LTS and will be [supported](https://symfony.com/releases/4.4) until EO 2022 (2023)
Will this be released for a csfixer v4? or v3.x? thank you
