@keradus want to merge with this:
```
"humbug/php-scoper": "dev-master as 0.14.2",
```
?

No, 0.15.0 won't help us, Scoper in this latest release requires `symfony/console` up to version 4: https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/blob/0.15.0/composer.json#L27
ComposerRequireChecker in all versions supporting PHP 8 required `symfony/console` 5: https://github.com/maglnet/ComposerRequireChecker/blob/3.0.0/composer.json#L34

Scoper on master requires what we need: https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/blob/master/composer.json so release would solve our problem.
