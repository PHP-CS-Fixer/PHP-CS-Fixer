Hi and thanks for your PR!

Looking good already. Could you adjust the test to only test the single issue here, maybe like:

```php
    public function testWhitespaceInDocBlockAboveNamespaceIsNotTouched()
    {
        $expected = '<?php
/**
 * This is a file-level docblock.
 */

namespace Foo\Bar\Baz;
';
        $this->doTest($expected);
    }
```

Thanks!

@paulbalandan CI is failing for proposed changes

@keradus or @SpacePossum , is it an acceptable fix to just remove the integration of the fixer against `single_blank_line_after_namespace`? Before this PR, `no_blank_lines_after_phpdoc` considers `T_NAMESPACE` as documentable that's why it gets an integration/priority check with `single_blank_line_after_namespace`. Now that this skips `T_NAMESPACE`, I think the integration/priority checks should be dropped too.

if there is no longer priority conflict between those two rules anymore, move test from `Integration/priority/` to `Integration/misc` and drop `tests/AutoReview/FixerFactoryTest.php:143:            [$fixers['no_blank_lines_after_phpdoc'], $fixers['single_blank_line_before_namespace']]` row

I have fixed the integration failure. Not sure if the removal of the priority comment in `SingleBlankLineBeforeNamespace` is warranted.

please avoid squashing the commits in future. now, I have no clue what are the newest changes and have to review from scratch :(
