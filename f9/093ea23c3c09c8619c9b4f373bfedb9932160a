Hi @keradus, this is my first PR on this project.
I'm sorry but I don't understand the test failure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-03-27T23:42:50Z

> @VincentLanglet to fix failing tests you have to regenerate docs: `php ./dev-tools/doc.php`.

But this command is changing the example 2.
It's like it's not using my second code sample.

I don't thin I get it - you already updated the docs with example 2 (as it's visible in diff), but it looks like you made some changes later. I believe if you regenerate docs the diff in this PR will look correctly.

The doc update does

Basically it replaces my second example by the first one.

@VincentLanglet not really, these are the changes from - your - 2nd example, they are just produce exactly the same as 1st example. To see it more clearly change something in your example, like variable `$connections` to `$array` and regenerate the docs.

Oh, I see.

Since
```
/** @todo This should be a PHPDoc as the tag is on "ignored_tags" list */
foreach($connections as $key => $sqlite) {
    $sqlite->open($path);
}
```
is untouched, it's not in the diff !

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kubawerlos at 2021-03-31T17:19:28Z

Exactly, I address this issue in https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/5585

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-04-03T17:16:35Z

Done @kubawerlos :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kubawerlos at 2021-04-03T20:40:24Z

@VincentLanglet for "PHPDoc having 2 different tags and only one of them in config" I meant PHPDoc like this:
```
/**
 * @foo text
 * @bar text
 */
```
and ignored tags only `foo`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-04-04T09:47:41Z

@kubawerlos Done, tahnks to this test, I discovered I should use matchAll. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-04-05T09:59:28Z

> @VincentLanglet I cannot fint that test with PHPDoc having multiple tags

I have added an example but no tests.
But now there is also a test with multiple tags.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2021-04-05T11:40:28Z

(each new) feature should be targetting master, imho
under which tag it would get released is another story, not blocking here

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-04-05T11:51:15Z

Done

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kubawerlos at 2021-04-07T14:00:43Z

@VincentLanglet can you rebase (and regenerate docs) your changes? The docs got the `@@` lines removed.

Done :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-05-05T11:53:40Z

@keradus @kubawerlos  Is there any issue with this PR ?
I was expecting this feature to be introduced in 2.19 but just saw you removed it from the milestone.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kubawerlos at 2021-05-05T13:17:36Z

> I was expecting this feature to be introduced in 2.19

I thought the same, @keradus should it aim 3.1 now?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-05-22T11:37:38Z

I rebased the PR to fix the conflict.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-05-31T22:08:44Z

Friendly ping @keradus.

Would it be possible to get some feedback ?
I'd like to avoid rebasing this PR again and again

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-06-07T20:32:38Z

@keradus @kubawerlos Is there any interest in this PR or should I close it ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by julienfalque at 2021-06-07T20:38:49Z

@VincentLanglet I think this feature is interesting and should be merged, but this requires time and maitainers don't have much these days, please be patient :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> @VincentLanglet I think this feature is interesting and should be merged, but this requires time and maitainers don't have much these days, please be patient :)

Sure, I understand this. I was just expecting at least one comment to be sure I don't rebase (and fix the conflict)  regularly for nothing.

The branch is now up to date. Let's wait and see 🤞🏻 =)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kubawerlos at 2021-06-09T15:20:39Z

This is definitely something worth merging, but only @keradus, @SpacePossum and @julienfalque can do it, approving running workflow before that.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-07-11T18:49:05Z

Friendly ping @keradus

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-07-30T08:29:29Z

@keradus Would it be possible to get some review ? :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2021-07-30T10:41:42Z

I think we could do with 2 examples, one with default config and one with a single excluded tag.
Maybe we should document that the excluded tags are matched case insensitive as well.

There is already 4 examples
- One with default config
- One with single excluded tag
- One to show it's cade insensitive
- One to show it support multiple tag in the same docblock

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2021-07-30T11:10:14Z

Yeah I saw the 4, but I think 2 is enough if we would update the docs stating the ignored tags are matched case insensitive.

Having more tests would be better than more examples. Like a test with `@ignore-me` for the special chars from the regex, `@TODO` to test the case insensitive matching works, `@TODOnot` to test the word matching works (so it doesn't match when configured `'todo'`). What would be a sane tag look like to have the `\\\\` in the regex?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-07-30T11:24:17Z

Done @SpacePossum

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2021-07-30T11:35:18Z

thanks :+1: if the pipeline succeeds than RTM from me

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by VincentLanglet at 2021-07-30T11:48:45Z

> thanks 👍 if the pipeline succeeds than RTM from me

Tests were failing because of the doc, it might be better now I hope.
