Please avoid force-pushes next time. Now, I have to review everything instead of checking the changes only

@liquid207
Not sure about the force push, but now all the fixes here https://github.com/liquid207/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2 are in conflict.
Is there anything you want me to help with the PR? As it sits now it cannot be merged IMHO  given the namespace issue.

@SpacePossum
Sorry for my force push..  I resolve the conflicts and merged your PR to my branch, and fix a little bug, now all changes in here.

One last little minor, can you squash into one commit with you as author and committer? It will make a nice single commit new feature and the PR will be marked as `merged` and not as `closed`.

squashed, @keradus @SpacePossum Thanks for your help.
