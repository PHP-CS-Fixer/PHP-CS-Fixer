Thanks for the PR!  Any update on when this might get merged in so that #5809 can get merged in?  I can't upgrade to v3 in my PHP 8.0 project until they're merged because of the issue with attributes being accidentally marked as global functions (#5722).  Thanks again.

@davidbyoung it needs to be reviewed, feel invited to do it.

Good morning.  Is there anything outstanding that we need for this PR to be merged in besides being updated to latest?
