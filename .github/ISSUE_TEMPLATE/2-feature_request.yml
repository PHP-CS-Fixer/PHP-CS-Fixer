        Before requesting a new feature, make sure your version of PHP-CS-Fixer is up-to-date.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > For initial ideas it's preferable to use [discussions](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer/discussions/categories/feature-ideas).

        As a maintainers we prefer to have only actionable issues in the backlog, with clear definition of done,
        that's why Discussions are the best way to start. When scope of the request is established, then actual issue can be created.
