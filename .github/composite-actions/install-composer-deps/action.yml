    # The actions/cache is, on calling it in this composite action, reading the cache,
    # and then also register a shutdown function for the whole workflow, to write the cache afterwards.
    #
    # That registered shutdown function does _NOT_ have access to inputs.* nor steps.*.outputs for
    # `path` parameter, which is evaluated on both stages (read and write), yet `key` parameters
    # are evaluated on start only and are not affected by this issue.
    #
    # Unfortunately, when the issue is faced, it does not break the build, simply raises a warning
    # and completing the build successfully, yet without storing the cache:
    # > Warning: Input required and not supplied: path
