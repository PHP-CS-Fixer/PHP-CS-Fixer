I would not deprecate `braces` until we have extracted everything into dedicated rules. Everything is done in #4884 and #4885 but we decided to split #4884 into smaller PR to ease merging.

I am not suggesting deprecating the braces fixer. I'm suggesting deprecating the option in the braces fixer that proxies declare_braces.

Oh ok. Well, since the point is to deprecate the rule entirely, I'm not sure it's worth the hassle.
